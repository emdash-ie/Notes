# Web Threat Analyses

Many (most?) attacks occur at the user layer.

Network layer:

- Packet sniffing
- Man-in-the-middle attack
- DNS attack

Application layer:

- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting
- Cross-site request forgery
- Authentication breakdown
- Unvalidated input

Server layer:

- Denial of service
- OS exploitation
