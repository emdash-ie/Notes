# Module Contents

We’ll start with cryptographic primitives, then see how they’re applied to communication protocols.

## Topics (roughly chronologically)

- Introduction to ciphers
- Symmetric key cryptography
- Authentication, secrecy, and integrity
- Cryptographic hash functions and their application
- Implementation issues and cryptographic APIs
- Identification techniques
- Authentication and key exchange protocols
- Design analysis and attacks on security protocols
    - e.g. Why are attacks still possible?
- Public key certificates and infrastructure
- Digital signatures
- Public key infrastructures

# Assessment

- 90% exam
- 10% continuous assessment

There will be a sample paper on the module website. The exam hasn’t been finalised, but will contain MCQs and longer questions. It should be possible to complete it in an hour.

# Labs

- 5 two-hour labs
- Potentially Mondays 15:00–17:00, G21
    - Though this clashes with a lecture for AI 1
- No labs in the first two weeks

# Where We Are

- Only in the last few years have companies started to take security seriously
- Many think they are taking it securely now, but are actually just throwing money at the problem
- Even the most secure system can be made vulnerable by people who are unaware of the risks of certain actions
