# Question 1 (20 marks)

## (a) (12 marks)

### Question

Show that the following result holds: if a comparator network sorts all binary bitonic sequences (i.e. bitonic sequences formed only from zeros and ones) then it sorts all bitonic sequences. This is a version of the zero-one principle. However, the fact that the zero-one principle holds does not imply the statement on bitonic sequences. Adapt the proof of the zero-one principle to verify that the above statement holds true.

### Answer

(Note: I’m not very confident in this answer – get onto me if you spot a problem)

The binary witness generator $f$ is monotonically increasing (so $a_i \leq a_j \implies f(a_i) \leq f(a_j)$). Because of this, given a bitonic sequence $[a_1, a_2, …, a_n]$, the sequence $[f(a_1), f(a_2), …, f(a_n)]$ is also a bitonic sequence.

Assume there is a sorting network that sorts all binary bitonic sequences, but there exists a non-binary bitonic sequence $[a_1, a_2, …, a_n]$ which is not sorted by this network. Then there is a pair $(a_i, a_j)$ where $a_i < a_j$, but $a_i$ appears after $a_j$ in the output from the network.

Then, since $f$ is monotonically increasing, $f(a_i)$ must appear after $f(a_j)$ when the network is applied to the sequence $b = [f(a_1), f(a_2), …, f(a_n)]$.

$b$ is a binary bitonic sequence which is not sorted by the comparator network, so the comparator network must not sort all binary bitonic sequences. Therefore, a comparator network which sorts all binary bitonic sequences must sort all bitonic sequences.

# Question 2 (20 marks)

## (a) (2 marks)

### Answer

The outcome is zero.

## (b) (2 marks)

### Question

What is the goal of the random attack algorithm?

### Answer

To solve the co-ordinated attack problem, but with a small possibility of disagreement.

## (c) (5 marks)

### Question

For the following set of triples, draw the graph depicting the corresponding good communication pattern. The set of triples for the good communication pattern is given by:

(1,2,1),(2,1,2),(1,2,3),(1,2,4),(2,1,5),(1,2,5)

### Answer

![](Question 2 (c).jpeg)

The values for $k$ are given on both sides of the diagram (redundantly), and indicate the round/time.

## (d) (5 marks)

### Question

Consider the good communication pattern depicted by the graph you drew under part (c). Indicate the information levels for the graph.

### Answer

| k   | $l_1$ | $l_2$ |
| --- | ----- | ----- |
| 0   | 0     | 0     |
| 1   | 0     | 1     |
| 2   | 2     | 1     |
| 3   | 2     | 3     |
| 4   | 4     | 3     |
| 5   | 4     | 5     |

## (e) (6 marks)

### Question

Compute the exact value of `ProbB[some process decides 0 and some process decides 1]` for the communication pattern drawn in (c), and using the information levels you derived in (d).

You can assume that the initial values for the two processes all are 1. Give sufficient detail in your argument to show how you arrived at the answer.

### Answer

```
n = 2
r = 5
```

For the RandomAttack algorithm, the processes decide 1 after r rounds if their information level is greater than or equal to the key.

If the key is 5, then process 1 will choose 0 but process 2 will choose 1, giving a disagreement. Any other value for the key (i.e. one of $\{1,2,3,4\}$) will cause both processes to agree to output 1.

So the probability of disagreement for the given adversary is $\frac{1}{5}$.

# Question 3 (20 marks)

## (a) (5 marks)

### Question

What is the time complexity for convergecast in case of a directed graph? Justify your answer.

### Answer

The time complexity is $O(diam^2)$.

The initial broadcast takes $diam$ rounds to send a message from the starting node to every other node in the graph (as $diam$ is the greatest distance between nodes in the graph).

As the graph is directed (and so messages from children to parents may have to travel indirect routes), the notification stage for fanning the results back to the route has to proceeed sequentially, one level at a time, which is what makes it $O(diam^2)$.

## (b) [5 marks]

### Question

What is the communication complexity for convergecast in case of a directed graph? Justify your answer.

### Answer

The communication complexity is $O(diam^2|E|)$, because at most $E$ messages can be sent in each round.

## (c) [5 marks]

### Question

The LubyMIS algorithm makes random choices of Unique Identifiers (UID’s) from the set 1 . . . n4, for each of the n processes. Give an upper bound for the probability that two such UID’s coincide and justify your answer.

### Answer

An upper bound is $\frac{1}{n^4}$.

There are $n^4 * n^4$ possible UID choice pairs, and of those $n^4$ contain the same number twice. So the probability of coinciding is $\frac{n^4}{n^4 * n^4} = \frac{1}{n^4}$.

## (d) [5 marks]

### Question

Describe how the LubyMIS algorithm picks the initial independent set in the graph, and why this choice yields an independent set.

### Answer

In eash stage, the algorithm assigns a random unique identifier to each process. Every process which is a local winner (has a greater ID than all its neighbours) is added to the independent set.

As no two neighbouring nodes can simultaneously be larger than all their neighbours, this selection of nodes must form an independent set.
