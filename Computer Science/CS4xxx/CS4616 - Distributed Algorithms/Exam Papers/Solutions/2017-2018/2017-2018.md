# Question 1 (20 marks)

## (a) (12 marks)

### Question

Show that the following result holds: if a comparator network sorts all binary bitonic sequences (i.e. bitonic sequences formed only from zeros and ones) then it sorts all bitonic sequences. This is a version of the zero-one principle. However, the fact that the zero-one principle holds does not imply the statement on bitonic sequences. Adapt the proof of the zero-one principle to verify that the above statement holds true.

### Answer

(Note: I’m not very confident in this answer – get onto me if you spot a problem)

The binary witness generator $f$ is monotonically increasing (so $a_i \leq a_j \implies f(a_i) \leq f(a_j)$). Because of this, given a bitonic sequence $[a_1, a_2, …, a_n]$, the sequence $[f(a_1), f(a_2), …, f(a_n)]$ is also a bitonic sequence.

Assume there is a sorting network that sorts all binary bitonic sequences, but there exists a non-binary bitonic sequence $[a_1, a_2, …, a_n]$ which is not sorted by this network. Then there is a pair $(a_i, a_j)$ where $a_i < a_j$, but $a_i$ appears after $a_j$ in the output from the network.

Then, since $f$ is monotonically increasing, $f(a_i)$ must appear after $f(a_j)$ when the network is applied to the sequence $b = [f(a_1), f(a_2), …, f(a_n)]$.

$b$ is a binary bitonic sequence which is not sorted by the comparator network, so the comparator network must not sort all binary bitonic sequences. Therefore, a comparator network which sorts all binary bitonic sequences must sort all bitonic sequences.
