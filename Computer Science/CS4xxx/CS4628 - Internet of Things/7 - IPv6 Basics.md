- revised version of IPv4

Mainly invented to deal with IPv4 address exhaustion, as all IPv4 address blocks have been allocated as of 2011.

NAT was used to bridge the gap between IPv4 and IPv6, but breaks network transparency and causes problems.

# Base Header

Only has 8 fields (vs. 14 for IPv4). Ditched some stuff that hasnâ€™t been useful.

Still a much bigger header, which means a lot of overhead for IoT applications.

# Extension Header

Base header is followed by 0 or more extension headers.
