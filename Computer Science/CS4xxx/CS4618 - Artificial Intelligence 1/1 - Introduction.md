# Introduction

## What is Intelligence?

- Sometimes defined in terms of test, e.g. Turing Test
    - But this is a test of language skills
- Sometimes defined in terms of various skills
    - But there’s an endless list of skills, and it keeps changing
- Bridge’s definition: A system’s degree of intelligence is defined in terms of its capacity to act autonomously and rationally when faced with disorder, uncertainty, imprecision, and intractability.
    - disorder measured by entropy
    - uncertainty measured by probability
    - imprecision measured by fuzzy logic (e.g. 0.67 true)
    - intractability measured by big-o analysis
