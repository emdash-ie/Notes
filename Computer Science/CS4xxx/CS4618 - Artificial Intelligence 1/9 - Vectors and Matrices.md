# Intro

About giving loads of data to the A.I. system, and it tries to find patterns / learn something from the data.

This is the big growth area of A.I. at the moment. This is because at the moment there is more data available than ever before. Also because we have faster hardware and greater storage capabilities.

# Pandas vs. Numpy

In general we will read data in using pandas, then convert it to numpy to use it with scikit learn.

# Numpy Speed

Numpyâ€™s built-in vector and matrix operations are faster than doing it in a loop. (For one, implemented in C).
