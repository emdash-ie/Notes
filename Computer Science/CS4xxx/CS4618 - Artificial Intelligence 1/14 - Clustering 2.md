# Intro

We cover a bottom-up (agglomerative), hierarchical algorithm.

# Linkage Comparison

- For complete linkage, the exact values don’t matter, just the order of them (the max is chosen)
- For average linkage, the exact values do matter
- These values can be distorted by e.g. scaling

# Zoo Dataset

- Why did he drop two examples from it?
  - frog was in there twice, and “girl” was in there (why not human?)

# Constraints

- No easy way to specify these kinds of constraints with k-means

# Adjusted Rand Score

- real formula is pretty gruesome
