# The Curse of Dimensionality

- images are an example of something with many features

- look up cosine similarity
- look up principal component analysis (eigenvectors etc.)

- new axes are chosen in order of importance (by definition)

1. Find principal components (axes that cover the greatest spread, then second greatest, etc.)
2. Remove the least important ones

- Common technique for visualisation â€“ reduce to 2 or 3 dimensions
