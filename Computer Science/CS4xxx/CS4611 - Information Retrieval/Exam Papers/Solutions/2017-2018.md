# Question 4 (20 marks)

Consider the following web graph:

- Page A points to pages C and E
- Page B points to A and C
- Page C points to B
- Page D points to E

## (a) (3 marks)

### Question

Compute the adjacency matrix corresponding to this graph.

### Answer

|     | A   | B   | C   | D   | E   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A   | 0   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 1   |
| B   | 1   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   |
| C   | 0   | 1   | 0   | 0   | 0   |
| D   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 1   |
| E   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   | 0   |

## (b) (6 marks)

### Question

Compute the probability matrix for this graph, where teleporting has a probability of 0.2.

### Answer

|     | A    | B    | C    | D    | E    |
| --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| A   | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.44 | 0.04 | 0.44 |
| B   | 0.44 | 0.04 | 0.44 | 0.04 | 0.04 |
| C   | 0.04 | 0.84 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.04 |
| D   | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.04 | 0.84 |
| E   | 0.2  | 0.2  | 0.2  | 0.2  | 0.2  |

## (c) (1 mark)

### Question

Say a websurf is definitely starting on page E. Determine a probability vector for this situation.

### Answer

```
x = (0, 0, 0, 0, 1)
```

## (d) (10 marks)

Use the probability vector obtained under Question 4 (c) to compute an approximation of the page rank score of these pages, using two power iterations only.

```
x' = xP
x'' = x'P
```

$$ x' = (\Sigma^m_{k=1}x_{1k}P_{k1}, \Sigma^m_{k=1}x_{2k}P_{k2}, \Sigma^m_{k=1}x_{3k}P_{k3}, \Sigma^m_{k=1}x_{4k}P_{k4}, \Sigma^m_{k=1}x_{5k}P_{k5}) $$

$$ x'_{1} = x_{11}P_{11} + x_{12}P_{21} + x_{13}P_{31} + x_{14}P_{41} + x_{15}P_{51} $$

$$ x'_1 = (0 * P_{11}) + (0 * P_{21}) + (0 * P_{31}) + (0 * P_{41}) + (1 * P_{51}) = P_{51} $$

$$ x'_{1} = P_{51} = 0.2 $$

$$ x' = (0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2) $$

$$ x''_{1} = (0.2 * 0.04) + (0.2 * 0.44) + (0.2 * 0.04) + (0.2 * 0.04) + (0.2 * 0.2)  = 0.152$$

$$ x'' = (0.152, 0.232, 0.232, 0.072, 0.312) $$
