Joins (cont.)
=============

Who likes pizza *and* beer?
---------------------------

Try a three way join (persons x favourite\_foods x favourite\_foods)
with the ON condition ensuring:

-   all three person\_ids match

-   favourite\_foods.food (first copy) should equal ‘Pizza’

-   favourite\_foods.food (second copy) should equal ‘Beer’

### Example:

> SELECT first\_name, last\_name, f1.food, f2.food\
> FROM
>
> persons AS p\
> JOIN favourite\_foods AS f1\
> JOIN favourite\_foods AS f2\
> ON
>
> p.person\_id = f1.person\_id\
> AND f1.person\_id = f2.person\_id\
> AND f1.food = ‘Pizza’\
> AND f2.food = ‘Beer’;

Note no quotes with AS when used like this, because we’re using it in a
different way.

Types of JOIN
-------------

We have been using the INNER JOIN (implicitly, by leaving out inner).
There are a few other types of JOIN, like OUTER, LEFT, RIGHT, and we may
see these later.

Movies example
--------------

Three tables:

-   movies

-   actors (info about each actor in the database)

-   castings (actor-movie combinations)

### List the max score obtained by any film released during the 60s:

> SELECT MAX(score)
>
> FROM movies
>
> WHERE yr BETWEEN 1960 AND 1969;

### List for each year the number of films released that year and the max, min, and average score obtained:

> SELECT yr, COUNT(\*), MIN(score), AVG(score), MAX(score)
>
> FROM movies
>
> GROUP BY yr;

### List the ids of all films starring Cary Grant:

We will need to use a join here, since we need both the actors and
castings tables.

> SELECT movieid\
> FROM
>
> actors JOIN castings\
> ON id = actorid
>
> WHERE name = ‘Cary Grant’;
