Example: Jolly Roger Airlines (JRA)
-----------------------------------

-   DB to hold the data (services, availability, prices, bookings etc.)

-   Scripts to handle various stages of the booking process

Typical booking session
-----------------------

1.  Customer submits trip details using a form

2.  Script "check\_services" interrogates DB for suitable services,
    packages the results as a HTML page, and returns this to the client

3.  The customer views the response and chooses desired flights

4.  Script "check\_availability" interrogates the DB for prices and
    availability of selected flights and returns the results as a HTML
    page

5.  The customer submits payment details

6.  Another script runs to finish the booking

What's important is that there's a script to advance each stage, and
that they are all triggered by client action, and that they all have DB
parts and non-DB parts.

We make some simplifications
----------------------------

-   Only one-way, point-to-point, single-seat bookings are available

-   Every service operates daily, every day in the year

A DB design
-----------

services (code, origin, destination, departure, duration, schedule)

flights (code, date, capacity, availability, price)

airports(code, name, timezone)

customers(customer\_id, first\_name, last\_name, email, password)

bookings(booking\_code, customer, service, date, credit\_card)

A query for checking for suitable services
------------------------------------------

Imagine a customer is interested in flights from Cork (ORK) to Paris
(CDG) on 01/12/2012:

> SELECT \*
>
> FROM services
>
> WHERE services.origin = ORK AND services.destination = CDG;

A script embeds the customer's choices (origin and destination here)
into a template query.

The selection of dates comes at a later stage because of the way our DB
is structured.

Checking availability and price
-------------------------------

> SELECT price, …
>
> FROM
>
> services JOIN flights
>
> ON services.code = flight.code
>
> WHERE
>
> services.origin = ORK
>
> AND services.destination = CDG
>
> AND flight.date = 01/12/2012
>
> AND availability &gt; 0;

This brings in the date, and displays prices just for available flights.

Recording bookings
------------------

The script for processing bookings would be built around a number of
statements:

-   Record the customer's details:\
    INSERT INTO customers VALUES (customer's id,…);

-   Record the details of this booking:\
    INSERT INTO bookings VALUES (booking code,…);

-   Update the availability into for this flight:\
    UPDATE flights\
    SET availability = availability - 1\
    WHERE flight.code = JR666\
    AND flight.date = 01/12/2012

Potential Problem
-----------------

With this simplified system, if two people book the last seat on a
flight simultaneously, or at least their bookings overlap slightly, then
they can both succesfully book the seat.
