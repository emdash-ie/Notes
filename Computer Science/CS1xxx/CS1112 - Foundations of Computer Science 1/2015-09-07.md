Lecturer: Barry O'Sullivan

There will be sign-in sheets handed out each lecture.

This course is about the mathematics of computing.

Very little similarity between leaving cert maths and the maths in this
course.

Computer science is the study of:

-   Computer systems

-   Computer software

-   Computation

    -   Some things can't be computed e.g. most real numbers. Some
        things take too many computations.

A model is a representation of (part of) a world that can be used to
explain or predict or demonstrate features of the world that is being
modeled.

For example: a map

Computer science is all about models.

The main aim of this module is to provide the skills needed to complete
the rest of the degree program.

Communication is very important:

-   The need to exactly communicate something to another person

-   The need to exactly understand something someone is telling you

Regular practice will be needed to succeed.

This module is about getting you to think in a particular way.

This module is slightly too fast to take notes. Will have to take our
own notes as well as the online notes.

Problem solving classes provisionally:

-   Monday 10–12, WGB.G20

-   Monday 3–5, WGB.G20

90 minute exam in December, 80%

Continuous assessment is 20%

Need A4 pad and pen to write down examples and solutions.
