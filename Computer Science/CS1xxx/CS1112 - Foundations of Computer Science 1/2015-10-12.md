Revision Lecture
================

He expects there'll be 5 questions on the exam, so that's 10 minutes per
question.

You won't be able to leave early.

He'll ask relatively precise questions, both to give us a chance to
answer precisely, and so it won't take a very long time to correct them.

*We will not be asked to write algorithms.*

Lab 1
-----

Won't be asked e.g. farmer logic puzzle.

Will probably be asked to give problems with algorithms (e.g. not
ordered, not terminating, etc.).

Lab 2
-----

Could be asked almost anything from this lab.

Remember extensional set definition is listing all the elements in {},
separated by commas.
