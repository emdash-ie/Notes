# Course Overview
---
### What you need
* There is a book, but it's not necessary, as he provides all his own material.
* You don't need a computer for this module, the lab computers will be enough.
* There will be between 40 and 80 handouts over the course of the year, which will be essentialâ€”we'll need a folder to keep those in.

### Assessment
* The module lasts the whole year, so there will be no exam at Christmas.
* There will be about 20 assignments, and 5 or 6 of these will be marked. He won't tell us which ones in advance, so we'll have to treat each one as if it will be marked.
* There'll be a practice exam in spring, to prepare for the summer exam.
