# Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries

---

## Tuples

Tuples are written with roundy brackets and with commas between each item[^1]:

[^1]: Technically you can write them without the brackets, but you need the brackets if you want to nest them.

	t = (1, 3, 5, 'hello')
	
The empty tuple is written `()`, and a tuple with one item must have a comma, e.g. `(0,)`.

The main difference between tuples and lists is that you can't change values that are within tuples, e.g. `t[3] = 4` â€“ this code will give an error.

## Sets

Sets are written with curly brackets. 

They can't contain duplicate elements (duplicates entered will automatically be detected, and won't be entered).

Checking if something is in a set using `in` is fast.

Sets also support mathematical set operations like union and set difference.

* The empty set is created using `set()` because `{}` is the empty dictionary.

* You can use set comprehensions to create sets, like with list comprehensions.

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are unordered sets of key:value pairs. The keys must be unique within a dictionary. They're written with curly brackets:

	d = {'France':'Paris', 'Ireland':'Dublin', 'England':'London'}
	
* `in` will check if a specific key is in a dictionary:

	`'France' in d` will evaluate to `True` for the dictionary above.

* For loops over a dictionary will loop through the keys in arbitrary order:

		for key in d:
			print(key)

* Values in a dictionary can be accessed using square bracket notation, similar to list indices:

	`d['France']` will return 'Paris' from the dictionary above.
	
	You can also change values in the dictionary or add new pairs using this notation:
	
	`d['Spain'] = 'Madrid'`
	
	`d['Ireland'] = 'Cork'`
