# Command-Line Programs

---

Instead of writing programs in python modules in IDLE, and using `def` to define your programs, you can write them in python files that can be run from the command line.

As the first thing in your program, you must have a shebang:

	#!/usr/bin/env python3
	
This tells the computer where the interpreter is.
