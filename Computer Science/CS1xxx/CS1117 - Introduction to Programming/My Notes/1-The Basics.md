# The Basics

---

* Programming is about breaking tasks down into tiny, simple steps, and then communicating those steps to a computer.

### Some Basic Python Commands

* print('string')
	* This outputs 'string' to the screen, without quotes. This is an example of a *function call*.
* name = 'Ann' 
	* Python grabs a block of RAM, labels it 'name', and gives it the value 'Ann'. 
	* If a variable called 'name' already exists, Python will change the value of that one, rather than grabbing a new block of RAM. This is called an *assignment statement*.
* #
	* A '#' symbol defines a line as a comment, which is ignored by the interpreter. Comments are used to explain programs, as they can quickly become unclear as they grow.
