# Server-Side XSL

---

Until now we've looked at client-side XSL, where the browser processes XML files according to the instructions in XSL files.

With server-side XSL, stylesheets are applied to XML on the server, and the result is sent to the client, rather than the xml itself.

We'll only look at an outline of the subject. This will not be examinable.

## Overview

1. Program on the server side is called by a client.
2. Program loads the XML, the stylesheet, processes the XSL, and returns the result to the client.

## In Python

If we want to do this in Python, we'll have to look up how to do it ourselves (there's probably an object class to deal with it).
