# The Exam

---

The test will be a test of understanding rather than of memory.

## Crib Sheets

* You are allowed bring a crib booklet, but don't bring so much that you're wasting time lookign through it all in the test.

* You can bring as many sheets of paper as you want, as long as they meet the following specifications:
	* They should only contain syntax and semantics of the languages we have been using.
	* They should not contain anything which could be understood as being an answer to a question or even a partial answer to a question.
* He will be in the exam hall and he will examine our crib booklets to make sure they fit the specification. He may confiscate the whole crib booklet if any of it doesn't fit the specification.

### Syntax and Semantics

We have used these languages:

* The DTD language
* The XML language
* The XSLT language
* The XHTML language
* The CSS language
* The XPATH language

We can bring any notes on the syntax and semantics of the various statement types provided by those languages.

You don't need to know every function name we've encountered, or the format of every statement in the languages we've used. These are the things we'll be able to bring in our crib booklet.

We will not be able to bring something like e.g. an algorithm for bubble sort.

Don't bring sheets with 3 or 4 lines which do something together.

Don't combine the `for-each` and `sort` examples into one, for example, keep them separate.
