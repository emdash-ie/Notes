# Character Processing

---

## Translate (`tr`)

`tr` is used for basic character substitution. Deals with a stream of characters. Stream editing can be programmed and run in batch mode â€“ suitable for large jobs.

### Metacharacters

For characters that have meaning to the shell (e.g. `<`, `>`, `'`, `"`), you can escape them by putting quotes (single or double) around them, or be using a backslash first.

## Regular Expressions (Regexp)

It's a way of specifying patterns. Used widely, supported by pretty much everything.
