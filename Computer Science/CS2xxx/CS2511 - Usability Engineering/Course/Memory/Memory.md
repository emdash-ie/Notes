# Human Memory

Memory is one of the most important features for interacting with software. We don't want software to provide a high load for human memory.

The human memory has three distinct stages. Information is:

1. Received through one or more of the *sensory memories*, e.g.:
    * Iconic (visual) memory
    * Echoic (auditory) memory
    * Haptic memory
    * These memories are very detailed.
    * They are specific to the medium they are storing, unlike short-term memory, which is more abstract and independent of the senses.
    * Kind of raw sensation.
2. Selectively held in *short-term memory* while it is analysed, after which it may be either discarded or:
    * This is independent of the senses and more abstract than sensory memories
3. Stored permanently in *long-term memory*.
    * We store a description (maybe a very rich description) of the sensory memories.

How can we use this transit to our advantage?

## Sensory Memories

These store raw memories (images, sounds, etc.) for very short periods of time (typically just a few seconds).

We can store things for longer if we get no new stimuli/sensations.

E.g. if we have no new visual stimuli, we can hold raw memory of a visual stimulus for longer.

He'll talk later about how we know how these work.

## Short-term Memory

Short-term memory involves largely conscious recall of information.

Information held in the sensory memories may be passed to the short-term memory for analysis and processing.

However, the capacity of STM is limited and hence only some sensory information receives attention.

Information held in short-term memory can be accessed in around 70ms.

The short-term memory can hold around seven items of information ("seven plus or minus two" – Miller, 1956). However, is it not easy to define an item of information. It might be:

* A single digit or character or word
* A long number or entire phrase, if that number or phrase is already known to the person

For example, if you hear an unfamiliar place-name, you may initially store it as a sequence of syllables. Once you become familiar with the name, it can be stored as a single item in short-term memory.

When hearing a series of numbers, some people stored 7 separate numbers, and some people stored patterns in the numbers, e.g. "my telephone number".

Storing information in short-term memory involves mental effort.

Because of this, information held in STM is easily lost:

* an interruption may demand our attention, forcing other information out of STM
* it's difficult to maintain information in STM for more than very short periods, so a long delay may result in items being lost
* information is discarded when it no longer appears useful, so e.g. completing a task may cause us to flush all associated information from STM

### Example: ATM

Early ATMs varied in the order in which they performed these tasks. Most returned the card last of all, when all requested services had been completed.

Users left after collecting their money or balance statement. They forgot to collect their card, because collecting the money was the primary task.

Collecting the card was a secondary task. On completion of a primary task, secondary tasks are often forgotten.

Most modern ATMs return the card before carrying out the requested services. This was it's harder to leave the card behind.

### Summary

* Short-term memory is the gateway to long-term memory. Information is held in STM while is it being learned.

We don't take anything into our long-term memory without conscious thought.

## Long-term Memory

Long-term memory provides permanent storage of information. Information held in long-term memory can be accessed in around 100 ms.

The capacity of long-term memory is huge, apparently unlimited. Forgetting takes place slowly, if at all.

Recall after a few hours or days is usually no different from recall after a few minutes. Decay stabilises vs. short-term memory.

If information makes it to long-term memory, it is effortless to store it.

There are three main processes associated with long-term memory:

* Storage/learning
* Information retrieval
* Forgetting
    * Also how we confuse things

### Storage/learning

Information passes into long-term memory via the short-term memory.

Not everything that is held in short-term memory is eventually stored in long-term memory.

The main factors determining what is stored are:

* Rehearsal
    * If you rehearse something enough, you can transfer almost anything into memory
* Meaning
    * If something is meaningful to you, you will store it much more quickly

## Long-term Memory (continued)

### Storage/Learning

Rehearsal (repeated exposure to data or consideration of it) increases the likelihood that it will be stored in LTM.

* Ebbinghaus found that the likelihood of long-term recall is directly proportional to the total period of exposure to the material – the total time hypothesis.

* Baddeley found that the likelihood of long-term recall varied according to the pattern of exposure rather than the total period.
    * Brief but regular exposure produced long-term recall more effectively than infrequent, prolonged exposure – the distribution of practice effect.
    * Though it might be to do with re-ordering of info by the brain when you sleep.

Meaningful information is more likely to be stored in LTM than meaningless data.

* Bartlett found that subjects who were asked to learn a story about an unfamiliar culture tended to recast the story within their own culture, and this aided recall.
* He coined the phrase effort after meaning to describe the way in which people organise information to make it easier to recall.

Learning may be improved by reinforcement through several senses.

* Baddeley notes that performing any kind of action while reading or listening to material increases the likelihood that it will be recalled.
    * Using key-clicks to cycles through a list promotes learning more than merely pressing once to access the entire list.
    * The key-clicks help create a richer memory trace

Research has also shown that reading material and hearing it spoken at the same time improves recall.

* It doesn't seem to make much difference whether the spoken version is produced by another voice or by the reader's own voice.
    * This may be why people often read aloud when trying to memorise something: reading aloud or even mouthing the words silently (sub-vocalisation) - improves recall.

### Information Retrieval

There are two types of information retrieval from LTM:

* Recall: The recovery of information as a result of a conscious search
* Recognition: The automatic recovery of information as a result of an external stimulus.

Recognition is the less complex cognitive activity, and is almost instant.

For this reason, modern computer interfaces rely heavily on recognition rather than recall.

Instead of having to recall commands - as in a command-line system - users merely have to recognise commands from menus.

#### Recall

During recall, we access long-term memory either episodically or semantically.

* Episodic memory represent our memory of events and experiences.
    * It allows us to access items in serial form, reconstructing sequences of events and experiences from earlier points in our lives.
* Semantic memory represents relationships between information.
    * It allows us to access information without regard to the order in which it was acquired or the sense through which it was acquired.

Semantic memory is assumed to be arranged as a semantic network.

Items are arranged in classes, and may inherit attributes from parent classes.

Researchers have shown that the delays which occur in recall can be modelled accurately as a network. The greater the number of levels in the hierarchy that have to be traversed, the longer the recall.

We don't know that this is the way it works, but it fits the facts.

Recognition jumps straight into the network instead of having to traverse it.

### Forgetting

There are two main theories to explain the loss of information from long-term memory: decay and interference.

* decay: Ebbinghaus concluded that information is lost through natural decay.
    * His experiments suggested that the decay is exponential, i.e. information is lost rapidly at first but then more slowly.

* Interference: new information may replace or corrupt older information
    * For example, changing your telephone number may cause you to forget your old number
        * This is known as retroactive interference
    * However, there may also be times when older information 'resurfaces' and becomes confused with newer information
        * For example, you may suddenly recall an old telephone number and confuse it with your new one.
        * This is known as proactive inhibition.

Many psychologists believe that we never really forget anything - we just lose access to certain parts of the stored information.

This is almost impossible to prove, since losing access to data has the same effect as losing the data.

However, phenomena such as proactive inhibition suggest that information remains stored even when it appears to have been lost.

# Memory Use and Computer Interaction

When using a computer, human memory is used to store various types of information:

* Long-term memory:
    * System commands, features, etc.
* Short-term memory:
    * *status variables* such as position within task sequence, current mode, etc.
    * *task variables* such as factors affecting your choices, selections previously made, etc.
    * *new system knowledge/skills* such as commands, features, etc.
    * *new non-system knowledge/skills* such as e-learning content

## Long-term Memory

Generally not seen as that big an issue compared to short-term memory.

The main concern in relation to LTM is supporting recognition rather than recall. Some techniques are:

* Choose meaningful icons, command/function names
* Use appropriate screen layout, grouping of icons, menu structure, etc. so that icons and menu items are easy to find

## Short-term Memory

The main concerns in relation to short-term memory are:

* minimising the load presented at any one time
* minimising the period for which items have to be remembered

Various techniques can be used to minimise the problems posed by status variables, task variables, and the learning of new knowledge/skills.

### Status Variables

* identify options which have been selected of rejected (e.g. by providing a summary)
* identify visited links (by changing their colour)
* minimise the use of modes and/or provide visual reminders (e.g. changing cursor shape or screen layout)
* users may forget what they're waiting for if a response is too slow or a sequence is too complex, so provide:
    * summaries of requested data, search terms, etc.
    * maps/overviews of search paths
    * visual reminders of status, e.g. breadcrumb trails

### Task Variables

* Place relevant information on one screen (use screen as external memory)
    * e.g. allow side-by-side comparison of products
        * moving backwards and forwards between pages to compare products is very demanding on memory
    * use a consistent data format to simplify consideration/comparison
    * highlight similarities/differences
* Allow users to make selections/vary parameters/etc. and see the results continuously rather than discretely
    * e.g. use a slider to set maximum price, update display as slider is moved
    * This could be described as using sensory memory (specifically visual memory) rather than short-term memory

### Material to Be Learned

* Make terms meaningful
    * Use a consistent naming convention, consistent syntax
    * Place them within a relevant structure (e.g. spatial layout)
* Allow users to explore material through multiple modalities
    * e.g. sight, hearing, touch
