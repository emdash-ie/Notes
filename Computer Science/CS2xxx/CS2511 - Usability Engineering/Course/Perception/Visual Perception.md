## Visual Perception

We often think of our visual system as an extremely accurate reproduction of the world around us, but that's not really the case.

The human visual system can be divided into two stages:

* physical reception of light
* processing and interpretation

The human visual system has both strengths and weaknesses:

* certain things cannot be seen even when present
* processing allows images to be constructed from incomplete information
    * e.g. negative space

### Structure of the Eye

Only the fovea provides a lot of detail, right in the centre of our vision. Our peripheral vision is very inaccurate.

The brain covers the blind spot either by guessing at what's there or remembering what's there.

The lens in our eye causes an upside-down image on our retina.

Two types of sensor:

* rods (in the retina)
    * high sensitivity to light
    * monochrome
    * low resolution
* cones (in the fovea)
    * limited sensitivity to light
    * colour (red, green, blue)
    * high resolution

There are around 6 million cones, mostly in the fovea, and about 120 million rods, mostly situated around the periphery.

### Visual Field

Because we can only focus on a very small area at a time, we scan scenes […]

We have a good spatial memory that allows us to remember (e.g.) where a particular piece of info is on the screen.

[…]

### Brightness Perception

Luminance is a physical property that can be measured.

The luminance of an objects depends on:

* the amount of light falling onto its surface
* The reflective properties of the surface

Contrast is related to luminance – it if the difference in luminance between the brightest and darkest parts of an image.

Perception of brightness is subjective.

The human visual system compensates for bright or dark conditions by:

* varying the iris aperture to regulate the amount of light reaching the retina
* using the lens to direct the image onto different parts of the retina:
    * in bright conditions, light is focused on the fovea, giving high resolution and colour vision
    * in dark conditions, focus is shifted onto the periphery, giving greater sensitivity but reducing resolution and colour perception

#### JND

We can measure the *just noticeable different* under various conditions.

Increasing the brightness:

* improves visual acuity
* increases perception of flicker (flicker may become obvious even at higher frequencies)

### Colour Perception

The total number of colours (rather than hues, at about 150) we can distinguish is much higher (it's typically estimated at 7,000,000 when accounting for hue, saturation, and brightness).

This is because:

* Each of the pure hues can be mixed with white in various quantities to produce other colours
    * e.g. pink is a different colour to red
    * we refer to the spectral hues as fully-saturated colours
    * when mixed with white, we refer to them as partially-saturated or de-saturated
* The brightness of hues can be changed as well

* Look up CIE triangles and Maxwell triangles if interested in primary colour systems
    * A 3-primary-colour system doesn't get all colours we can see
    * If we used enough primaries to get all colours we can see, some combinations wouldn't produce a colour we can see

The RGB approach offers:

* good colour consistency across machines, since the colours chosen are easy to specify and reproduce with accuracy
* all mixtures of the primaries yield valid colours
* a wide range of colours, although there are some colours that cannot be created.

Only around 2-3% of the cones in our eyes are sensitive to blue light, so discrimination between different shades of a colour is worse for blue than for other colours – we can see more shades of green.

The eye is most sensitive to green light.

About 8% of men and 1% of women have some for of colour-blindness (usually red-green).

Colour-perception is "pre-attentive" – people with normal colour vision perceive and discriminate colours immediately and without conscious effort.

### Distance Perception

Visual angle alone doesn't determine perceived size, as objects at a distance and up close may have the same visual angle, and we're good at gauging objects' size (even at extremes of range).

We also use:

* binocular vision - difference in the image seen by each eye
* head movement - small changes in viewing position produce changes in view that allow distance to be gauged
* monocular cues - require only one eye
    * relative size
    * relative clarity
    * relative height
    * […]
* familiarity / pattern-matching

#### Binocular Vision

Each eye sees a slightly different scene – retinal disparity. The closer the object, the greater the disparity.

#### Convergence

To view objects at different distances, we adjust our focus (this is convergence).

Feedback from eye muscles tells us how much adjustment has been made and so how far away the object is.

Convergence is very difficult to recreate on a screen because everything is in focus and on the same plane.

Because this cue is absent, we can subconsciously tell that something's wrong, and so it takes more effort to use 3D displays for long periods of time.

#### Head Movement

The information obtained from retinal disparity and convergence can be enhanced by moving the head.

Feedback from our muscles tells us how far we have moved, and hence the distance between two viewing positions.

By comparing retinal images and eye-convergence information from two (or more) positions, we can obtain greater information about depth and size.

#### Monocular Cues

* Relative size
    * where an image features several objects of similar shape, the tendency is to assume that the smaller objects are further away (unless there's contradictory evidence)
* relative height
    * where the base of a shape is higher than that of a similar shape, the one with the higher base is assumed to be further away
    * this cue relates to the horizon
* reduced clarity
    * reduced clarity in some parts of an image implies distance
* interposition
    * when one object is interpreted as obscuring part of another one, the one which seems to be obscured is assumed to be further away
* texture gradient
    * texture gradient can be seen as a combination of linear perspective and relative size
    * areas in which particular shapes are densely packed will appear more distant than areas in which similar shapes are less densely packed
    * e.g. cobblestones leading away
* perspective
    * we find it hard to avoid interpreting converging lines as indicating linear perspective
* depth cue shadow
    * we tend to assume the light source comes from above if we don't see another light source
    * also tend to assume objects are viewed from above and not from below
* familiarity / pattern-matching
     * when processing visual information, we are primarily seeking to identify objects in the visual field
     * we expect certain objects to be of a particular size, and use this information to help us interpret a scene

### Ames Room Illusion

What happens when some visual cues suggest a particular interpretation of a scene but others suggest a different interpretation?

Ames (1946) built a room in which the walls on one side were considerably higher than those on the other side, but were also further from the viewing position. He then placed two people in different parts of the room.

Looking from the right position, it looks like the two people are extremely different in size.

### Distance Perception (cont.)

If some of the visual cues conflict with others, our visual system makes a best guess.

* We'll notice it at some level, meaning we'll get tired faster
* harder to use these systems

### Pre- and Post-Attentiveness

Eye-movement and focus typically take around 200ms.

Visual tasks that involve eye movement and focus are said to be post-attentive. Pre-attentive

#### Examples

* pre-attentive:
    * simple colour-identification tasks
    * e.g. finding an object of a particular colour among a group of coloured objects
* post-attentive:
    * identifying/comparing size, shape, etc.
    * task involving a combination of factors, e.g. colour plus size

### Reading

Research shows:

* People read from a computer screen around 25% more slowly than from printed material. Adults typically read print at around 250 words per minute.
* People scan material on screen more than they do printed material (e.g. read progressively less of each line / paragraph as they move down the screen).
* People dislike scrolling.
* People dislike wordy text (on computer screens).

This may be because computer screens and the typography and layout often used on computers don't adequately support adult reading strategies.

When children learn to read, they initially read linearly:

* read each word in turn
* identify the meaning of each word (possibly letter by letter)
* identify the meaning of each sentence

This is slow and inefficient. As children become more proficient, they learn to scan text by spotting key-words. This process involves a number of stages:

* Identify a word or character
    * long words recognised as quickly as single characters
    * shape important here
* guess the meaning of the phrase or sentence
* confirm/disprove the guess
    * the reader jumps forward through the text looking for words or characters that will confirm/disprove the guess
    * forward jumps are known as saccades (the eye movement?)
* revise the guess if necessary
    * if a guess cannot be confirmed, it may be necessary to back-track and revise the guess
    * backward jumps are known as regressions

We typically read 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 words of what we're reading (fewer for dense materials).

# Factors Affecting Legibility

* Font-style and capitalisation
    * pattern-recognition is crucial to reading, so typefaces with distinct patterns are easier to read than other. Block capitals are particularly hard to read (for extended periods).
* Font size
    * Font sizes from 9-12 points are equally legible (assuming proportional spacing)
    * larger and smaller sizes are less legible
    * line length also important – want to facilitate saccades rather than forcing people to skip lines
* Character spacing
    * proportionally-spaced text is easier to read than text with fixed-spacing.
* Line length
    * lengths of between
* Text colour
    * […]

Morkes and Nielsen (1997) asked subjects to rate versions of a page – they created versions which contained the same information but presented/worded it differently.

* abbreviated text – 58%
* text split into single lines – 47% better
* objective language only – 27% better

Combining all three approaches was rated 124% better than the original.

Concluded it's best not to provide too much info at the top level, that way people can choose to see more info that they are specifically interested in.

# 2D vs 3D

Why do we not use 3D?

* maybe cost
    * good 3D technology is more expensive and less available than 2D

But there's also research suggesting that 2D is better for many practical applications.

* cognitive/perceptual effort
    * 3D takes more effort from the viewer than 2D
    * in 3D, some cues may be absent, incomplete, or misleading
    * presenting incomplete/incorrect 3D information increases the cognitive load
* abstraction vs. realism
    * we are used to seeing abstract 2D views, but expect 3D views to be realistic
        * generalisation
    * 2D views are better suited to scaling, zooming, etc.
    * these may be just because we're used to 2D and may go away once we get used to 3D

3D is suited to applications that involve the visualisation of real objects and their orientation/relationship to other objects:

* medical imaging
* mechanical modelling
* architectural modelling
    * layout of internal spaces
    * sightlines

2D tends to be better suited to applications that involve exploration or visualisation of abstract data, e.g.:

* a computer's file structure
* financial and commercial data

3D displays are increasingly used in visualisation of complex, multi-dimensional data. However, many designers recommend avoiding 3D if alternative 2D representations can be used.

Games break all of these rules – a game can be very hard to use according to HCI but the motivation from enjoyment of the game is strong enough to overcome it all.

## Screen as External Memory

By presenting a lot of information at once we can use the screen as external memory and reduce the load on the user's short-term memory.

However, studies suggest that users skim material on webpages, and that it is usually best to minimise the amount of material per page.

You need to be clear how the material on the screen is to be used:

* for tasks that involve comparison, analysis, decision-making, it is usually best to place as much relevant information on screen.
* for most other purposes, users won't read lengthy passages from a screen, so minimise the amount of text and make it as readable as possible

## Complex Data

When presenting complex data:

* colour is a good choice of cue because it is perceived pre-attentively
    * but some people are colour-blind, so provide redundancy and/or allow customisation
* shape and size are perceived post-attentively, but can still be used effectively
* brightness is a poor cue because humans adapt to it
    * though contrast?

## Text

When presenting text:

* choose appropriate fonts, font-sizes, etc.
* minimise the amount of text by removing all unnecessary material
* avoid descriptions
* break up the text using (e.g.) bullet points

If using longer passages of text is unavoidable, try to minimise its complexity. There are a number of methods that can be used to measure the complexity of a passage of text:

* average reading time
    * a group of people are asked to read the text, and the average time taken is noted
    * not easy to do quickly / on a deadline
* Cloze technique
    * subjects are asked to read a piece of text in which every fifth word is blanked out
    * the index is based on the percentage of blanked words that are guessed correctly
    * texts with simple, predictable structures usually obtain high scores
    * still a lab measure (takes time + effort)
* Fog index, Flesch reading ease test, etc.
    * take into account factors such as average word and sentence length, percentage of complex words, etc.
    * grade texts in various ways:
        * on a scale from 6-17, indicating the age at which pupils should be able to ready text of that complexity
        * on a 100-point scale
    * very good for US English, not so good for anything else (even Irish English)
    * however, it's super quick
        * many word processors have built-in readability tools
        * tools are available online
