# Conceptual Design

Conceptual design should describe what appears on the screen at each stage in the interaction.

The design should take relevant guidelines into account, and may also be based on formal modelling, etc.

* Want applications to be intuitive as much as possible
    * no longer acceptable to just provide a manual and training

Useful to use a metaphor â€“ think about the software with a particular mental model "think of this software like *this*"

## Mental Models

* Adults typically try to use existing models, while children try to make new models
    * can lead to adults being defeated by a new situation/model
