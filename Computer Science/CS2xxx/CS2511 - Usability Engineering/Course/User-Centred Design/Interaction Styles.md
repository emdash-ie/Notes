# Interaction Styles

## Direct Manipulation

* incremental action at the interface with rapid feedback allows people to cancel actions as early as possible if there are problems

## Advantages & Disadvantages

Though more difficult to script, it gets better from generation to generation.

## Anthropomorphic

* don't really have a successor to direct manipulation yet
* this is a very general term â€“ in the future we'll probably have more terms and classifications here

## Examples

* menu selection used for kiosks because it's clear and direct manipulation would be overkill

## HTML5

* modular standard

* will soon support many interaction styles

    * Touch API supports gestural interaction
