# Sample Problem

---

Given two strings or lists of elements, determine whether or not they are anagrams â€“ exactly the same bag of elements.

To simplify the problem, consider lists where the elements are selected from integers between 0 and 9999 inclusive.

## First Attempt

Step through one list and check the other.

	for each item in word:
		i = 0
		found = false
		
		while not found and i < length(word2):
			if item == word2[i]:
				found = true
				word2[i] = None
			else:
				i = i + 1
				
		if found == false:
			return false
		
	return true

### Analysis
	
Triangular number formula: 0.5 * n * (n + 1)

In the worst case (more or less), we will have to step through the inner loop approximately this many times. This is slow.

## Second Attempt

Maintain a dictionary of elements seen in the first, reduce the count by one at each letter. If the dictionary returns to 0 afterwards, they are anagrams.

	for each i from 0 to len - 1:
		dict[word1[i]] += 1
		dict[word2[i]] -= 1
		
	for each value in dict:
		if value != 0:
			return false
	return true
	
### Analysis

The first loop is on the order of 2n, the second is on the order of 10000. Overall, 2n + 10000. This is slow for small inputs but far faster for large inputs.

If n is 1000, the second process gives 12000 instead of 500000.

You could improve this by building the dictionary as you go instead of beforehand, so that it's rarely 10000 elements in size.

## Third Attempt

Sort both words first, then step through each simultaneously and make sure they're identical.

	sort(word1)
	sort(word2)
	for each i from 0 to n-1:
		if word1[i] != word2[i]:
			return false
	return true
	
### Analysis

The loop takes n steps in the worst case. Python's sort algorithm is of the order nlogn, giving 2nlogn + n.

## Summary

For large input, the second attempt (dictionary) is best. For small input, the third attempt (sort function) is best.

Two things to take away:

* We need to analyse how complex our algorithms are and see if they're too slow.
* We need to run stress tests to analyse the run times of our algorithms.
