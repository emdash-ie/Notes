## Sorting

* Unstable sorting can be annoying for users
    * they expect previous sorts to be respected
* You need to implement sorts yourself when there are no libraries
    * it's important to know which sorting algorithm to choose
* If developing software for real products in well-designed and well-supported languages, you should normally use their built-in sort routines
    * They will have been optimised for the language design
