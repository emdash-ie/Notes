# Intro

* list of sample questions on moodle

* past exam paper also

# Exam

* need to know 16 lectures (but not the 2 about practice at the end)

    * not the research topics one either

* paper organised in 4 sections, corresponding to the big sections of this course

    * different sections are allocated different marks

    * total for exam is 80 marks

# Technique

* answers should be clear, even if short

    * start of answer should place the answer in context

    * e.g. "Give a definition of the process and analyse it."

        * contrast process vs. program

        * talk about context

* "analyse the set of operations…"

    * give clear explanation of the purpose of the different operations

        * e.g. what it means to create a process

* "explain purpose of process scheduling"

    * explain why it's needed, maybe overview some different strategies

    * explain in a way that makes it understandable to someone who didn't study this topic

* "challenge of scheduler in multi-code system"

    * adhering to the admin policy

* explain the component structure of TinyOS

    * this is an interesting question, as the approach of TinyOS is different from other things

    * TinyOS uses tasks rather than processes – talk about difference

* fork vs. vfork vs. clone

    * parent process suspended for vfork, child uses parent context

    * expectation with vfork is that it will be followed by exec

    * clone is about sharing resources – some are shared, some are duplicated

* don't neglect drawings when asked for them
