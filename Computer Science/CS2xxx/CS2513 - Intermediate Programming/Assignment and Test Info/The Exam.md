# The Exam

---

* There's a sample paper on moodle. It's quite similar in structure to the exam we will do, though the content is different.

* You will not lose marks for e.g. forgetting an underscore once, as that's more of a typo. However, if you were consistently missing underscores, you would lose marks for that.

* For questions like the importance of OOP to a development team, make sure you're answering the question you're asked â€“ relate your answer back to the question.

* It's good to know the assignments.
