You're assigned an academic mentor and possibly a workplace/industrial mentor during the work placement.

* You keep a logbook that's signed off on by your industrial mentor

* Website lists companies, you can see job descriptions and work summaries
    * Always ask for job descriptions
        * Some small companies may struggle with putting that together
    * Work summaries are done by students who've been on placement describing their placement, including some advice for people.
    * Be open when looking at job descriptions – don't think that you can't do it, don't limit yourself

* Websites list interview schedules as well, and the results of the interviews.

* Majority of recruitment is done around or before November. Interviews may be happening every day for the first few weeks.

* CVs are sent out in the first week back in September. Important to get them prepped now.

* Try to use placement as a means of travelling, e.g. to UK or EU.

* There's an option of a 12-month placement, which means you take your final year with another group.

* There's info on the website about organising your own placement.

* Hard to get a placement in the States if you don't have your own visa.

* Ask if the placement is paid at latest when you get the offer.

# Shortlist, Interview & Selection

* CVs sent out in September 2017
* Employer shortlists students based on CVs
* Interviews commence mid September 2017
* Interview schedule is on the placement website
* Feedback available

You're given a list of companies, you select a minimum of 5-7 out of a potential 40 that you'd like to work with.

You have to be happy to go to any of those companies – you **have to take the first offer you're made**.

* Students from last year have said that they limited their choices too much on the list.

Interview feedback is available from most employers.

Interview results will be posted on the web. Successful students will always be called and put in touch with the company.

# Work Placement Agreement

Agreement between us and our work placement manager.

* If a company wants to interview you directly, let Clodagh know.

During the first few weeks in September, check the website multiple times per day.

* Research any companies you're choosing.

* If there's a company you really like but the job description doesn't suit you, consider applying anyway. There may be a job you prefer in the future with them.
