    * They'll want to know how you think on the spot
    *
3. Over To You

    * Not what's the pay because you haven't been offered the job.
    * You have more to gain from placement than the company has to gain from giving you the placement.
    * Way to show you're interested in a company
    * Don't be afraid of showing your interest, e.g. "I'm really keen to get this placement, is there anything else I can do?"
