There will be a sample questions document on Moodle, which describes the exam and provides sample questions.

Lecture 17 and section C of Lecture 11 are not required for the exam.

Questions should provide justifications for decisions made (e.g. “I’m using a topic, because x, y, z.”).

The exam is not looking for you to learn off the lecture notes, but instead know about and understand solutions – why do we have middleware, and what are the best approaches in different situations (and why)?
