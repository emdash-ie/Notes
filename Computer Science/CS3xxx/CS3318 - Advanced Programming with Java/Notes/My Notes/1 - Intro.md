# Intro

* Main rule: don’t make it harder for speakers or listeners to concentrate on the lecture

* Attendance is taken

* 10 practicals (week 2 to 11 inclusive)

    * should know by next week

* CA will be lab assignments

* enrol via Moodle

## Subject

* More about the realities of doing software development, etc. than the programming itself

* Java project management

* Advanced Java programming

* The amount we’re supposed to cover is unrealistic, so we’ll cover what we can

# Tools

* We’ll be using Java 8 (Java 9 isn’t ready yet)

    * Standard edition

* Any professional java programming is probably going to require you to use an IDE (sometimes a specific IDE)

# Deployment Pipeline

* Develop

    * IDE

* Manage

    * Version control

* Build and Test

    * Integration server

        * e.g. CI

        * won’t really look at this

* Deploy

    1. Development environment

    2. Testing environment

    3. Production environment

In parallel we’ve got testing tools (JUnit) and build automation (maven/gradle).

* build automation can tie into the integration server

# Programming

## Teams

* probably won’t be developing solo

* teams can be complex
