# Intro

The theory of computation deals with three Cs:

* Computability: How we know whether a problem is computable?

* Complexity: How fast does a program fun? How much memory does it use?

* Correctness: Can we tell whether a program is correct?

We will deal with computability and complexity in this course.

# Mars Rover

* Look it up – there was a software bug that caused it to stop right after it landed

# Exponentials

* exponentials tend to be problematic, e.g. Finding the possible subgroups of a large group.

# Deck of Cards

* there are 52! permutations/shuffles for a deck of cards

* you can’t generate all these combinations

* best you can do is take a sample (or a few samples), and hope that it’s representative
