Lecturer: Steve Prestwich (s.prestwich@cs.ucc.ie)

8-week module, split into two groups of 4

It’s a continuous assessment module, with 100 marks from an exam, 60 for assignments, and 40 for miscellaneous workshops.

Notes will be emailed out.

# Languages

We’ll cover 3 languages in the first 4 weeks: C, Objective-C, and C#

We won’t go to expert level in these languages, but provide a grounding and contrast them.

# Books

C programming:

- “The C Programming Language” by Kernighan & Ritchie (optional)

# Labs

These are the lab times for the moment, but one of them clashes with a workshop, so they may be rearranged:

- Wednesday 12-1, WGB.G24
- Thursday 11-12, WGB.G24
