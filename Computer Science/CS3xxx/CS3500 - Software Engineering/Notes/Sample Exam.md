# Notes

Don’t provide more things than requested – if 2 are requested, only the first 2 will be counted. Any subsequent answers will be ignored.

Where there are lists of things (e.g. today’s lecture on XP), you won’t be asked to give the whole list – you may be asked to demonstrate understanding of one of them, for example.
