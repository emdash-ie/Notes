# Structure

90 minutes, 80 marks (roughly 1 mark/minute)

All questions list the marks, so you can tell how much time to spend on them.

4 equally-marked questions (2o marks per question)

## Question 1

Parts (a) - (d), marked 2, 8, 5, 5, marks respectively

### (a) List the main components in a typical microcontroller [2 marks]

Warm-up question

### (b) [8 marks]

Looks for code (just relevant piece of code). Very simple code (LEDs and switches involved).

### (c) [5 marks]

Labelled diagram, relating to part (b).

### (d) [5 marks]

Update (b) to do [something else he hasn’t told us]. Look at the start of the notes to see the kind of stuff that’s here.

## Question 2

3 parts, 4, 10, and 6 marks respectively

Single theme across question 2.

### (a) [4 marks]

ADC

### (b) [10 marks]

Circuit diagram, code.

Voltage divider.

### (c) [6 marks]

Code.

## Question 3

All about C.

5 parts, distribution 6, 4, 3, 4, 3 marks.

### (a) [6 marks]

6 parts, 1 mark each.

Things like declarations (how do you declare this/that?).

Be comfy with pointers.

### (b) [4 marks]

Code fragments, loop, pointers.

### (c) [3 marks]

2 parts.

“Explain what each of the following statements [missing word: does]:”

Addendum: After both are executed, what is the value in a particular variable?

Mark per explanation, mark for addendum.

### (d) [4 marks]

Bitwise operators.

Writing code to do something.

### (e) [3 marks]

Also bitwise operators.

## Question 4 [20 marks]

5 parts, 2, 3, 2, 5, 8 mark distribution.

Interrupts, timing, speed of counters, etc.

Writing hardware interrupts.

If you’ve done any coding at all in the project, that should be easy.

Very little coding in this question.

### (a) [2 marks]

What is [blank]?

We can guess it from the later questions.

### (b) [3 marks]

Description.

### (c) [2 marks]

Arduino `attachInterrupts()`.

### (d) [5 marks]

Speed.

### (e) [8 marks]

Description.
